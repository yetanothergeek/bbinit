Not included here, but this is the "Swiss Army Knife" executable that
performs many of the functions used by bbinit. It is also copied to the
initial ramfs, therefore your build of busybox should be a statically
linked binary not requiring any additional shared libraries. It should
have most of the available "applets" enabled. As of this writing, 
the default build in the Arch Linux "community" repository works nicely.
For Alpine Linux you should ensure that you have installed the 
"busybox-static" apk package before building the initramfs.

The busybox packages from OpenSuse and VoidLinux WILL NOT WORK!
They are missing some key features required to bring up the system.
Better to grab the latest precompiled version from :
  https://busybox.net/downloads/binaries/ *-defconfig-multiarch/busybox-*
or build your own statically-linked busybox from source, preferably 
using musl-gcc.

For handling hotplugging events on recent kernels it is strongly 
recommended that your busybox has the "uevent" applet enabled.
