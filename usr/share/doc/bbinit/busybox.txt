Not included here, but this is the "Swiss Army Knife" executable that
performs many of the functions used by bbinit. It is also copied to the
initial ramfs, therefore your build of busybox should be a statically
linked binary not requiring any additional shared libraries. It should
have most of the available "applets" enabled. Earlier versions of bbinit
tried to rely on distro-provided /bin/busybox for some systems, but this 
turned out to be an unreliable and fragile dependency. So for now bbinit 
depends on a user-provided /lib/bb/busybox . Hopefully more detailed
instructions and perhaps an automated installer will be implemented.
Note that newer versions of Arch Linux (and possibly some others)
have switched to using ZSTD compression for kernel modules, which
upstream busybox does not support. However there are  some patches 
available to add ZSTD compression support to busybox and its module
utilities. (This is also on my TODO list)

For handling hotplugging events on recent kernels it is strongly 
recommended that your busybox has the "uevent" applet enabled.

Generally speaking, the biggest, fattest, most feature-filled busybox
configuration is probably your best bet. Most of the extra features
don't add much to the binary size and might even come in handy for 
other use cases, even if bbinit doesn't strictly require them.
