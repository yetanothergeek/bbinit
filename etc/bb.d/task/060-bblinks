# with "busybox blah" but for long running processes (daemons) it 
# is more convenient from a user perspective to have these processes
# show up in "ps" output etc. by their real name rather than having
# a bunch of processes all listed as "busybox". So we need symlinks
# for each applet we want to show up as itself. But since /bin etc.
# might be read-only, we will create these links under /run/bbinit.
