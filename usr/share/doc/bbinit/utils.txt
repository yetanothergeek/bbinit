The /usr/share/bbinit/utils/ directory contains some non-essential files
which might come in handy when working with bbinit. Some of them might
also be useful outside the scope of this project.

/usr/share/bbinit/utils/bbck:
This script will test a build of busybox to see if it is suitable for use
with bbinit.

/usr/share/bbinit/utils/findmemdisk:
This is a "busybox port" of the syslinux "memdiskfind" utility to search 
for a MEMDISK instance and output the parameters needed to use the "phram"
driver in Linux to map it. It might be useful, for example, if your
initramfs needs to mount an ISO (cdrom or dvd) image that was booted with 
syslinux's "memdisk" loader.

/usr/share/bbinit/utils/pxesrv:
An easy-to-use script to run a PXE server using only syslinux and busybox.
(PXE is a technology for booting a computer from an operating system served
over a network connection.)

/usr/share/bbinit/utils/solister:
A script to read an ELF executable file and output a list of shared library
dependencies required to execute the file. It performs a similar function
to programs such as "ldd" and "lddtree" but it is written in busybox shell
and uses only busybox applets. You might use it if you want to add additional
programs to an initramfs image.
