/etc/inittab => /etc/bb.d/conf/inittab:

This file controls some aspects of the startup and shutdown of the 
system, including the launching of the /etc/bb.d/rc* scripts and the 
initialization of the tty terminals used for login. It is required
when using the bbinit system. Unfortunately the path of /etc/inittab
is hard-coded into busybox and therefore its location is 
non-negotiable, so...

THIS GETS TRICKY: In order for bbinit to coexist with another init system
which requires a different adaptation of /etc/inittab, bbinit uses 
this strategy:

It stores its own version of inittab in /etc/bb.d/conf/. At boot-up, it checks
whether the contents of /etc/bb.d/conf/inittab and /etc/inittab are identical.
If they are, all is good, and no further action needs to be taken. But if
the two files differ, bbinit will "bind mount" its own /etc/bb.d/conf/inittab
over the existing /etc/inittab, thus masking the contents of the original 
and preserving it for booting with the other init system.

The bind-mount strategy is required for "openrc" or "sysv" init, but not for
"systemd" or other setups like VoidLinux's "runit" system. For systems which
don't already have /etc/inittab, the file should simply be a symbolic link 
to /etc/bb.d/conf/inittab.

But EITHER WAY, a file named /etc/inittab MUST exist on the system!
