BUGS/LIMITATIONS:
Probably there are many. There is currently no support for advanced filesystem 
handling such as LVM or encrypted root filesystems. 

One particularly annoying problem is that when you (or your package manager)
update busybox, the system is not able to cleanly unmount the root filesystem
on the next reboot. This is because the old busybox is still in use (because it
is the PID #1 init) hence the filesystem stays "busy" as long as "init" is 
running. This is generally harmless, but /etc/bb.d/rc0 will spend a lot of time
trying to unmount the drive before finally giving up and rebooting while the
device is still mounted, triggering an automatic fsck on the next boot.
