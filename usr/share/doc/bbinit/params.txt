KERNEL COMMAND LINE PARAMETERS:
Most bootloaders allow you to pass additional arguments to the kernel at
boot-up. The initramfs created by bbinit recognizes and specifically handles
the following kernel parameters:

init=PROGRAM
Tells the init script the path and name of the program on the root filesystem 
to be executed after initramfs initialization process is complete. This program
will have the process id (PID) of #1. The default is /sbin/init but in order 
for bbinit to properly continue, this parameter should be set to
init=/etc/bb.d/init


root=DEVICE
Tells the init script where to look for the root filesytem to switch to once 
the initramfs initialization is complete. For example if your "real" Linux 
installation is on the first partition of the first hard drive, you could say:
  root=/dev/sda1

The initramfs also recognizes the form of root=LABEL=XXX or root=UUID=XXX
where XXX is the label or uuid of the root filesystem. 

The special case of root=self is handled differently; rather than mounting a
separate root filesystem, the initramfs will pass control to from /init to 
its own /sbin/init (or whatever program you specified as init= on the kernel
command line.) This may be useful for debugging purposes, and for situations
where a separate filesystem is not easily accessible such as a PXE boot 
environment.


rootdelay=N
Tells the init script to wait up to N seconds for the root device to appear. 
This is needed particularly on USB devices which are sometimes slow to respond.
The default is 20 seconds which is usually enough time for the device to appear
but you might need to increase it if you have an unusually slow USB interface.
Note that the script continues as soon as the device appears so there is 
really nothing to gain by reducing the timeout to less than the default, 
other than failing a little sooner if the device does not exist.


loglevel=N
Where N is a whole number between 1 and 8. This controls how much information
is printed to the screen during boot-up, with a value 1 showing only critical
error messages, and a value of 8 being maximum verbosity.

quiet
This parameter requires no arguments and is simply an alias for loglevel=1


mdev.log
This parameter requires no arguments and if present will tell mdev to log
all device events to a file named /dev/mdev.log

autologin=USER
Tells bbinit to automatically login the user named USER on tty1 
when boot-up is completed. ( This only works if 
/etc/bb.d/conf/autologin.conf is set to AUTOLOGIN=? )
